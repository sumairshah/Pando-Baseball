## Projecting Professional Major League Baseball Salaries

The business problem: Create a model that predicts the career earnings of odds of making to the Majors,Arbitration,Free Agency,for active Minor League and Major League Baseball Players



Baseball is statistically the toughest sport to make it to the highest level once turned pro, and once drafted. Pando a startup out of Palo Alto has created an opportunity for players to join pools with other professional players. By joining a pool, a player will diversify their risk, protect against the uncertainty and unlikeliness of making it to the Major Leagues, and other stages of their career. My project will help Pando pitch to players the likelihood that they will make money with and without a pool depending on what features that player has. 
The data consists of data on both pitchers and hitters for the last thirty years. The data has information on players that could be contributing factors. It has three different columns on salary as well as all details that may contribute to a player’s ability to have a successful career and earn a lot of money. 
Modeling: In preparing the data I will have to look at what factors are correlated with salary and also make assumptions about null-values. Similar to the Real-Estate case study it will be very important to learn how to deal with columns with null values and decide which attributes are important in my project. 
Evaluation I plan on plotting the data first to see what factors may be strongly correlated, next I would clean the data and then use linear regression and potentially logistic regression. After looking at the models I would then decide how to make my model better. 
Deployment: I would evaluate my model and make the necessary adjustments, maybe drop or add certain columns into my model depending on the results I am getting. I also would add splines, and try and fit my models in other ways to see how they would affect my model going forward. 
I would go back at this point and see if I could have cleaned my data any better or if I could have done anything better. 


## Motivation
As an avid baseball fan, and former collegiate player, I have had numerous former teammates and friends weigh the financial risks of chasing a professional career. Having the oppurtunity to play professional baseball is a risk that leaves many players with little to no money after playing minor league baseball for years. 

Pando a startup out of Palo Alto came up with a "pooling-concept"
